## Design Challenge
**What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?**
<br>
The goal of the main activity of my project is to understand how users consume news. Specifically, I hope to get a better understanding of why users consume news (do they look at the news with a specific topic in mind to learn about, or do they look at news outlets just to explore what is going on in the world at the moment?) and the process with which they do this. My activity will give me insight into how users look at the news in a natural environment.
<br>
<br>

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**
<br>
This activity satisfies users' esteem needs. Through reading the news and gaining knowledge, users are able to find a feeling of accomplishment. Understanding the news can also lead to feelings of mastery, self-confidence, and independence in the users' improved understanding of the world. 
<br>
<br>

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
<br>
The traditional solutions to satisfy the same needs are paper newspapers. Users could choose to get their newspapers delivered on the daily, or pick them up at stores. These newspapers contain similar information to that on news websites; they cover a wide range of news spanning from local announcements to worldwide events. Other current solutions that satisfy the same needs as news websites are television news channels. The parent of news websites, these channels allow users to consume thesame information, but with arguably less freedom. Users simply turn on their televisions to listen to news anchors, but have no ability to explore different topics from the same news outlet. 
<br>
<br>

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
<br>
Some current limitations of consuming news online is difficulty in sorting through content to find topics that are interesting to the user. News websites are exteremely abundant in information, which can run into the risk of overwhelming the user. Thus, they could benefit from better content organization and information visualization.
<br>
<br>

## Target Users
**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
<br>
The demographics of news website users are typically those that are young adults and above and have access to a personal device to consume the content on. These users tend to have a desire to keep up-to-date with current events and enjoy learning about the world. Though users do not require any particular level of expertise to use the site, it would be of benefit to users to have prior knowledge with navigating websites, since news outlet websites tend to be more content heavy than other sites.
<br>
<br>

**Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)**
<br>
anywhere - on the way to work, at home, anywhere that they can comfortably use their personal technological device
<br>
<br>
**What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)**
<br>
goal: to understand current events and trending news 
operation: go on the website and look around on the homepage to see if anything interests them. or, they would go on the site with a topic in mind to research, and go immediately to the search function 
<br>
<br>

## Research Methods and Plan
<br>
For my research, I decided to conduct a **participatory observation**. To accomplish this, I asked my roommate to complete a series of activities to explore news website usage patterns and also get an understanding of her thoughts on the visual design/ organization of the site. Please review the section below for the materials used.
