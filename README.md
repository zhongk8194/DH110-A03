## Design Challenge + Target Users
**What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?**
The goal of the main activity of my project is to understand how users consume news. Specifically, I hope to get a better understanding of why users consume news (do they look at the news with a specific topic in mind to learn about, or do they look at news outlets just to explore what is going on in the world at the moment?) and the process with which they do this. My activity will give me insight into how users look at the news in a natural environment.

<br>

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**
higher version of esteem? -> need for knowledge. or is this self-actualization?
<br>
<br>

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
<br>
<br>

**What 
is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
<br>
<br>

What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
