## Design Challenge
**What is the main activity your project would support the users’ needs?**
<br>
The goal of the main activity of my project is to understand how users consume news. Specifically, I hope to get a better understanding of why users consume news (do they look at the news with a specific topic in mind to learn about, or do they look at news outlets just to explore what is going on in the world at the moment?) and the process with which they do this. My activity will give me insight into how users look at the news in a natural environment.
<br>
<br>

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**
<br>
This activity satisfies users' esteem needs. Through reading the news and gaining knowledge, users are able to find a feeling of accomplishment. Understanding the news can also lead to feelings of mastery, self-confidence, and independence in the users' improved understanding of the world. 
<br>
<br>

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
<br>
The traditional solutions to satisfy the same needs are paper newspapers. Users could choose to get their newspapers delivered on the daily, or pick them up at stores. These newspapers contain similar information to that on news websites; they cover a wide range of news spanning from local announcements to worldwide events. Other current solutions that satisfy the same needs as news websites are television news channels. The parent of news websites, these channels allow users to consume thesame information, but with arguably less freedom. Users simply turn on their televisions to listen to news anchors, but have no ability to explore different topics from the same news outlet. 
<br>
<br>

**What is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
<br>
Some current limitations of consuming news online is difficulty in sorting through content to find topics that are interesting to the user. News websites are exteremely abundant in information, which can run into the risk of overwhelming the user. Thus, they could benefit from better content organization and information visualization.
<br>
<br>

## Target Users
**What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise)**
<br>
The demographics of news website users are typically those that are young adults and above and have access to a personal device to consume the content on. These users tend to have a desire to keep up-to-date with current events and enjoy learning about the world. Though users do not require any particular level of expertise to use the site, it would be of benefit to users to have prior knowledge with navigating websites, since news outlet websites tend to be more content heavy than other sites.
<br>
<br>

**Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)**
<br>
Users can consume news anywhere — at home, on the way to work, or any location where they can comfortably use their personal technological device with internet connection. Users will most likely perform such an activity when they have time to spare or do not have any pressing tasks to attend to.
<br>
<br>
**What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)**
<br>
The goals of a user would be to learn about current events and trending news. To accomplish their goal, they would likely search for news on a search engine, or visit a news site that they are familiar with. Once on a website, the user would either look around on the homepage to see if anything interests them, or they would search for a specific topic that they have in mind and find relevant articles. 
<br>
<br>

## Research Methods and Plan
For my research, I decided to conduct a **participatory observation**. To accomplish this, I interviewed my roommate about her experiences with consuming news, and also asked her to complete a series of activities. With these methods, I hoped to explore news website usage patterns and also get an understanding of her thoughts on the visual design/ organization of the site. Please review the section below for the materials I used.

## Research Materials and Deliverables
Here is my <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hlftcgTstTGgIyE7GM145e0d-cWfpP69Q2iNJLMXvCg/edit?usp=sharing"> contextual inquiry guide</a> (interview script).

<br>
<br>

Here are some insights and observations from the interview: 
1. The user felt like the website she visited was too cluttered.
_"I don't think I would go back [to the site]. I'm just like, this is just like, too cluttered for me."_

2. The user noticed that a lot of links didn't look clickable, and she also pointed out the fact that users would have to keep going back to the homepage to read other related articles.
_"Like, if you're trying to like explore the news for not one specific topic, you have to keep coming back to this page."_

3. The user noted that depending on the category of the news, there should be different information visualization techniques implmented. For example, we agreed that for news about travel, articles could be more image heavy and lighter on the text. 
_"Oh, you're right. Like, we could consider the different categories. Like, for travel or something, maybe it's like more image heavy or something like that, but if it’s like politics or something then maybe it's more text."_

## Reflection
This research was a great way for me to learn about the different thoughts users might have when visiting a news site. By asking my interviewee to perform two tasks that simulate two different reasons why a user might visit a news site, I was able to gain insight into potential problems that users might face. For example, I learned that users may feel overwhelmed, since these sites are typically very cluttered with text and images. In terms of the interview process, it went very smoothly. However, after viewing my recording, I realized that some of the audio was too quiet. Next time, I would encourage users to speak louder, or I would simultaneously interview and record the audio on my phone. 

From this research, I also learned a lot about how to interact with users and make them comfortable to share their opinions. I would love to interview more users in the future so that I can get opinions from a wider audience range.
