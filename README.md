## Design Challenge + Target Users
**What is the main activity your project would support the usersâ€™ needs?**
The goal of the main activity of my project is to understand how users consume news. Specifically, I hope to get a better understanding of why users consume news (do they look at the news with a specific topic in mind to learn about, or do they look at news outlets just to explore what is going on in the world at the moment?) and the process with which they do this. My activity will give me insight into how users look at the news in a natural environment.

<br>

**What is the basic need involved for that activity?**
This activity satisfies users' esteem needs. Through reading the news and gaining knowledge, users are able to find a feeling of accomplishment. Understanding the news can also lead to feelings of mastery, self-confidence, and independence in the users' improved understanding of the world. 
<br>
<br>

**What is(are) the traditional/current solution(s) to satisfy the needs?**
The traditional solutions to satisfy the same needs are paper newspapers. Users could choose to get their newspapers delivered on the daily, or pick them up at stores. These newspapers contain similar information to that on news websites; they cover a wide range of news spanning from local announcements to worldwide events. Other current solutions that satisfy the same needs as news websites are television news channels. The parent of news websites, these channels allow users to consume thesame information, but with arguably less freedom. Users simply turn on their televisions to listen to news anchors, but have no ability to explore different topics from the same news outlet.

**What 
is(are) the limitation(s) that possibly would be improved with (digital) technology?**
<br>
<br>

What are the characteristics of users? (ex. demographics, preference, expertise) 
Where would the users do that activity? (i.e., context of use)
What would the users do to complete that activity? (e.g., goal, operation, method, action)
